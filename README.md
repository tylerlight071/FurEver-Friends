## Setting Up MongoDB 🍃

To use FurEver Friends, you need to have a MongoDB database. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Create a MongoDB Account**:

   - Visit the [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create an account.

2. **Create a New Project**:

   - After logging in, create a new project.
   - Give your project a name and create it.

3. **Create a New Cluster**:

   - In your project, create a new cluster.
   - Choose a provider and a region.
   - Choose a cluster tier. The free tier, M0 Sandbox, is sufficient for this project.
   - Give your cluster a name and create it.

4. **Create a Database User**:

   - In the Database Access tab, add a new database user.
   - Choose a username and a password. Remember these credentials as you'll need them to connect to your database.

5. **Get Your MongoDB URI**:

   - In your cluster, click on the CONNECT button.
   - Choose "Connect your application".
   - Copy the provided connection string (MongoDB URI).

Remember to replace `<password>` in the MongoDB URI with the password of the database user you created.

You can now use this MongoDB URI to connect to your MongoDB database from FurEver Friends! Everything else is automatically set up so you don't need to do anything past that point.
